First, text is closer to Genistat area of interests than music. Second, I think it is more obvious what is the state-of-the art in NLP than in music generators, and we can use open-sourced models to retrain it on lyrics dataset. Then, if time allows, I'd try some music generator (one from this list: <https://github.com/ybayle/awesome-deep-learning-music#dl4m-summary>). In the worst case scenario, we'll ask Michi to compose a music for us (he just said that he feels inclined to be a composer) and we add our AI-generated lyrics to it üòé Maybe synthesized with <https://github.com/MycroftAI/skill-singing>. Or we will sing it ourselves üôâ<br><blockquote>MycroftAI/skill-singing</blockquote>|

The more musical content created with AI, the more points you will earn (bubbles for everyone). Human interventions are allowed, but this will cost you points from the AI-panel. We're not completely anti-human, but we know how to appreciate an AI-performer.`|

If that won't work "good enough", only then we'll try different input voices using one of TTS networks.

Tried python package (midi2audio), desktop software but finally I end up with online converter (the only one that worked)<br>‚Ä¢ I mixed audio with voice. Needed to change the speed here, because lyrics were 5 minutes long and the melody was over 3 minutes. That obviously affected voice pitch (see my comments below)<br>‚Ä¢ I added rhythm track<br>My next step would be to start documenting everything &amp; then I could go back to some more experiments on the Python / generator models level, and first of all - trying to make voice sounding more like singing (maybe there's some quick-win alternative to Mellotron project, that failed badly)<br><br>If you will find some time, you could maybe do some experiments in Audacity or equivalent software (I can provide you with raw input files - MIDI and WAV)<br>‚Ä¢ better aligning of voice to melody (speech/singing is generally too slow, but if we speed it up, the voice does not sound natural)<br>‚Ä¢ better rhythm track<br>‚Ä¢ stereo with multiple voices of different pitches (multiple runs of text-to-speech) singing "unisono". Audacity also allows you to set "pannng" i.e. setting multiple voices in the stereo scene (more to the left, more to the right)<br>‚Ä¢ multiple instruments playing the same melody (also, we could add panning here)<br>‚Ä¢ better MIDI to WAV conversion (looking at amplitudes in Audacity, online converter compressed the audio quite a lot)<br>‚Ä¢ finally we could try other lyrics that we generated earlier (then I'd generate other melodic line)<br>What do you think `@basil.philipp`?|
